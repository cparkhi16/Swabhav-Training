Some concepts have names, and sometimes we care about those names, even (or especially) in our code.
At other times, we only care to distinguish one thing from the other. There are times when there’s no inherently meaningful value for a thing. For example, if we’re storing products in a database table we probably don’t want to store their category as a string. We don’t care how the categories are named, and besides, marketing changes the names all the time.
